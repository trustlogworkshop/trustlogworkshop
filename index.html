                    <p class="lead">
                        Learning on graphs is at the core of many domains, ranging from information retrieval, social network analysis to transportation and computational chemistry. Years of research in this area have developed a wealth of theories, algorithms, and open-source
                        systems for a variety of learning tasks. State-of-the-art graph learning models have been widely deployed in various real-world applications, often delivering superior empirical performance in answering what/who questions. For
                        example, what are the most relevant web pages with respect to a user query? Who can be grouped into the same community? What items should we recommend to best-fit user preferences? Despite the prosperous development of high-utility
                        graph learning models, recent studies reveal that learning on graphs is not trustworthy in many aspects. For example, existing methods make decisions in a black-box manner, which hinders the end-users to understand and trust model
                        decisions. Many commonly applied approaches are also found to be vulnerable to malicious attacks, biased against individuals from certain demographic groups, or insecure to information leakage. As such, a fundamental question largely
                        remains nascent: how can we make learning algorithms on graphs trustworthy? To answer this question, it is crucial to propose a paradigm shift, from answering what/who to understanding how/why, e.g., how the ranking of webpages
                        can be manipulated by the malicious link farms; why two seemingly different users are grouped into the same online community; how sensitive the recommendation results are due to the random noises or fake ratings.
                        <br><br> There are many challenges involved in trustworthy learning on graphs, including:

                        <p class="lead"> This one-day workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from different backgrounds to answer these research questions and enhance the trustworthiness of learning on graphs. The workshop will consist of contributed
                            talks, contributed posters, invited talks and discussion panels on a wide variety of methods and applications. Work-in-progress papers, demos, and visionary papers are also welcomed. We will also include invited papers for
                            both oral presentation and poster presentation. This workshop intends to share visions of investigating new approaches and methods at the intersection of trustworthy learning on graphs and real-world applications.

                    <p class="lead">Paper submissions are limited to a total of <b>5 pages for initial submission</b>(up to 6 pages for final camera-ready submission), plus references or supplementary materials, and authors should only rely on the supplementary material
                        to include minor details that do not fit in the 5-page main body. Manuscripts should be submitted in PDF format, using the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template"><b>ACM 2-column sigconf template</b></a>.
                        Paper reviews will be double-blind, and submissions that are not properly anonymized will be desk-rejected without review. Submitted papers will be assessed based on their novelty, technical quality, potential impact, and clarity
                        of writing. For papers that rely heavily on empirical evaluations, the experimental methods and results should be clear, well executed, and repeatable. Authors are strongly encouraged to make data and code publicly available whenever
                        possible. The accepted papers will be posted on the workshop website and will not be included in the CIKM proceedings. Special issues in flagship academic journals are under consideration to host the extended versions of best/selected
                        papers in the workshop.

                        learning. He also participates in technical planning. Prior to that, he was a technical leader and research staff member at IBM Watson Research Center, exploring graph database and reasoning framework, creating IBM System G (http://systemg.mybluemix.net/)
                        platform from scratch to support a behavioral anomaly detection project (ADAMS), and a social data monitoring project (SMISC), etc.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: center;">Nitesh V. Chawla is the Frank M. Freimann Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Notre Dame. He is the Founding Director of the Lucy Family Institute for Data and Society. He has also served as the director
                        of the Center for Network and Data Science. He is a Fellow of IEEE. Chawla, who joined the Notre Dame faculty in 2007, is an expert in artificial intelligence, data science, and network science, and is motivated by the question
                        of how technology can advance the common good through interdisciplinary research. As such, his research is not only at the frontier of fundamental methods and algorithms but is also making interdisciplinary advances through collaborations
                        with faculty at Notre Dame and community, national, and international partners. </p>

                    <p style="text-align: center;">Thomas G. Dietterich is Distinguished Emeritus Professor of computer science at Oregon State University. He is one of the pioneers of the field of machine learning. He served as executive editor of Machine Learning (journal) (1992–98)
                        and helped co-found the Journal of Machine Learning Research. In response to the media's attention on the dangers of artificial intelligence, Dietterich has been quoted for an academic perspective to a broad range of media outlets
                        including National Public Radio, Business Insider, Microsoft Research, CNET, and The Wall Street Journal. Among his research contributions were the invention of error-correcting output coding to multi-class classification, the
                        formalization of the multiple-instance problem, the MAXQ framework for hierarchical reinforcement learning, and the development of methods for integrating non-parametric regression trees into probabilistic graphical models.</p>-->
