                    <p class="lead">
                        Learning on graphs (LOG) is fundamental and essential to a wide range of web applications, including information retrieval, social network analysis, computational chemistry, and intelligent transportation. Researchers in the area have made significant 
                        contributions to theories, algorithms, and open-source systems tailored to address diverse learning tasks. State-of-the-art LOG algorithms have demonstrated superior empirical performance in answering what the optimal learning results would be to serve 
                        downstream web applications. For instance, what are the most relevant web pages based on user queries? What are the best groupings of online users to form online communities? What items should recommender systems offer to fit user preferences and to 
                        stimulate the growth of e-commerce platforms? Despite the substantial progress in developing high-utility LOG algorithms, recent research has raised concerns about the algorithmic trustworthiness in terms of several critical social aspects, including 
                        fairness, transparency, privacy, and security. Black-box LOG algorithms are also found to be vulnerable to malicious attacks, biased against individuals from certain demographic groups, or insecure to information leakage. The untrustworthiness would 
                        further limit the potential of LOG algorithm to be deployed in high-impact domains such as online banking and digital health. Therefore, it is essential to ask: why are LOG algorithms untrustworthy? And how can we develop and deploy trustworthy LOG 
                        algorithms? To answer these questions, it is essential to introduce a paradigm shift, from solely addressing what questions to understanding how and why. Such paradigm shift could benefit a wide range of web technologies, including fair and reliable 
                        anomalies, robust webpage ranking, fair information campaign on social media, as well as factual and private share of knowledge on web platform.
                        <br><br> There are several key research challenges involved in trustworthy learning on graphs, including:
                        <ul>

                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <p class="lead"> Building upon the success of its previous edition, this one-day workshop (TrustLOG-WWW'24) aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from different backgrounds to study these key challenges and enhance the trustworthiness 
                            of learning on graphs. The workshop will consist of invited talks, discussion panels, contributed talks, contributed posters on a wide variety of methods and applications related to trustworthy learning on graphs. The proposed workshop welcomes 
                            contributions in various format, including research papers, benchmarks and datasets, vision papers, position papers, and white papers. The TrustLOG workshop intends to share visions of investigating new approaches at the intersection of trustworthy 
                            learning on graphs and real-world applications.

                            <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Abstract</b>: Given a database of decorated graphs, with node- and edge-attributes, edge multiplicities and directions, and associated metadata for each graph, how can we spot the anomalous ones? Several real-world problems 
                                can be cast as graph inference tasks where the topology captures complex relational phenomena (e.g., transactions between financial accounts in a journal entry), along with metadata reflecting tabular features (e.g. approver, effective date, etc.), 
                                where the simultaneous handling of relational and tabular features poses a challenge.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: left;"> In this talk I will present a novel graph neural network model that handles directed multigraphs, providing a unified end-to-end architecture that fuses metadata and graph-level representation learning through an unsupervised 
                                anomaly detection objective. Experiments in two domains, based on general-ledger journal entries from different firms (accounting) and human GPS trajectories from thousands of individuals (urban mobility), validate the generality and detection 
                                effectiveness on expert-guided ground-truth anomalies. We also find that a built-in synthesis of the two data modalities (graph and metadata) outperforms the baselines that handle these separately with post-hoc synthesis efforts.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Abstract</b>: The burgeoning field of AI has seen significant advancements in the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, applying LLMs to graph-centric domains requires novel approaches that bridge the language 
                                space with complex, structured graph data. I will share our recent work in AI4Science, which focuses on integrating LLMs with graph-based data representations (e.g., 2D molecular graphs, 3D molecular point clouds, and graph-graph interactions). These works 
                                collectively propel forward the frontier of LLM-driven graph understanding and generation, offering new tools for scientists to harness the power of AI in their research. This talk will detail the paradigm, challenges, and potential impacts of aligning LLMs 
                                with scientific graphs, setting the stage for future innovations in AI-driven scientific exploration.</p>
